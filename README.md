# GRANDPA SPOON

**Problem** : As we age, hand tremors become more common. People suffering from Parkinson's Disease and neurological disorders suffer from this issue. Keeping the goal of finding a solution to aid them, I came up with a simple and affordable solution.

**Solution**: This  Grandpa-Spoon uses a gyro sensor to detect the angle caused due to the hand tremors and corrects the spoon to stay level using a servo motor. The correction is determined using our code which is based on the input of the gyro sensor. For these, processes are done by an Arduino Uno microcontroller.
